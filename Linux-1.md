#                                  # Linux Foundation

* __Linux â€“ The Operating System__

* RedHat Linux, Ubuntu,  Centos, SUSE etc are called as distributions.

* Distribution is Linux + software suite of applications,developer tools

* In this essence Linux is core of the operating system: `kernel`

  # Layers of Abstraction in Linux 

* __General Linux System Organization__

![preview](images/1.png)

* # Layers are
    
      * Hardware
      * Kernel
      * User Process

* __Kernel is in charge for managing__
     
      * Processes
      * Memory
      * Device Drivers
      * System Calls 
         * fork
         * exec   

# User Space: 

* Kernel allocates memory for user processes and this is called as userspace.

* User: A user is an entity that can run processes and own files.

# Shell and Terminal

* when we speak of the commandline we are referring to shell. Shell is a program takes commands and passes them to OS to carry out.

* Almost all the distributions a shell program called as bash is supplied.

* To interact with shell we need a terminal

* Prerequisities 

       * Softwares
           * Git Bash
           * Visual Studio Code

       * One free tier cloud account (AWS/Azure)    

* __Linux Distributions__

       * Ubuntu 18
       *  Centos 7

* Lets create a linux instance and login into that

# Standard Input and Standard Output

* Linux Processes use I/O streams to read and write data.
* Streams are very flexible, the source of input stream can be a file, device or it can be even the output stream of other process

# Linux Commands

* In the shell prompt we generally execute commands. Lets execute some simple commands

```
date
cal
```
![preview](images/5.png)

* #    Basic command syntax

```
<command> <args>
echo hello
```

![preview](images/6.png)
  
*  Arguments of two types 
    
    * Positional arguments:
```
<command> <arg1> <arg2> ...
cp 1.txt 2.txt
```
   
   * Named arguments

```
<command> --<argname> <argumentvalue>
ping -c 4 google.com 
```

# ls: 
   * this command is used to list the contents of the directory
     
     ```
     ls 
     ls -al
     ```
![preview](images/7.png)

#  touch: 
   * this command creates an empty file
   * ```
     touch 1.txt
     ```
#  cp: 
   * this command copies files
   * ```
     cp 1.txt 2.txt or file1 file2
     ```

```
Directories   | 	Description
/bin 	            binary or executable programs.
/etc 	            system configuration files.
/home 	            home directory. It is the default current directory.
/opt 	            optional or third-party software.
/tmp            	temporary space, typically cleared on reboot.
/usr 	            User related programs.
/var  	            log files.

# Environment and Shell variables

* __Shell variables__: Shell can temporarily store variables called as shell variables

```
<VAR-NAME>=<value>
TOPIC=linux
To access variable use $
echo $TOPIC
```

* __Environmental variable__: This is also like shell variable, but its not specific to the shell.

* Environmental variables in Linux are dynamic values that can affect the behavior of processes and applications on the system. They are used to store system-wide values, such as the locations of executables, the default editor, and system locale settings.

* Managing Environmental Variables

* Viewing Environmental Variables

* to view specific environmental variable 
* `echo $HOME`
* `echo $HOSTNAME` 

      * To view all environmental variables:
          * `printenv or env`
      
![preview](images/10.png)

 * To view a specific variable:
      * `echo $VARIABLE_NAME`

 * For example, to view the PATH variable:
      * `echo $PATH`

# Setting Environmental Variables

* __Temporarily (Session-specific)__: These variables last only for the duration of the session (i.e., until you log out or close the terminal).

```
VARIABLE_NAME=value
export VARIABLE_NAME

```
* Example

```
MY_VAR="Hello World"
export MY_VAR
echo $MY_VAR

```
![preview](images/11.png)

* __Permanently (Across Sessions)__: To make variables permanent, add them to configuration files like .bashrc, .bash_profile, or `/etc/environment`

* User-specific: Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile

```
echo 'export MY_VAR="Hello World"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

```

* System-wide: Add to /etc/environment

```
sudo echo 'MY_VAR="Hello World"' >> /etc/environment

```
* Example 1: Setting PATH

* Add a directory to your PATH so that executables in that directory can be run without specifying their full path.

`export PATH=$PATH:/new/directory/path`

* To make it permanent, add the above line to your `~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile.`
![preview](images/12.png)

* taking backup of orignal final `cp /etc/profile /etc/profil_orignal` for saftey purpose 
![preview](images/12.png)

* now to revert the value 
* `vi .bashrc` 
* change the value `TESTVAR=xyz to TESTVAR`
* `source .bashrc`

![preview](images/15.png)

* # Example 2: Setting JAVA_HOME

* For __Java applications__, you often need to set the JAVA_HOME variable to point to your JDK installation.

```
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin

```
* To make it permanent, add the above lines to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile.

* # Example 3: Custom Variable

* Create and use a custom variable for a session.

```
MY_APP_CONFIG=/path/to/config
export MY_APP_CONFIG
echo $MY_APP_CONFIG

```
* To make it permanent, add the export line to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile.

* # Conclusion

* Environmental variables are essential for managing the operating environment in Linux. They help configure the system, define user preferences, and ensure that applications find the resources they need. Understanding how to view, set, and persist these variables is crucial for effective system administration and user configuration.

```
export <variable>
```
* `There is one important environmental variable which is PATH. PATH variable will inform linux to find the commands`

```
echo $PATH
```

# Using Text Editors

* Every linux generally has a text editor which is vim.
* To learn using vim please refer here: https://www.openvim.com/ 
* Other editor is nano
